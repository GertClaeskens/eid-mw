*Content*

This 4.0 eidmw SDK will break radically with the older 2.x and 3.5 SDK API's.<BR>
We will no longer define our own API, but in fact use the cryptografic token interface standard PKCS#11 v2.11 API.<BR>
The PKCS#11 v2.11 specification can be found at [http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2133 RSA ]

The PKCS#11 v2.11 API will allow you to check for detected cardreaders and card and will allow to retrieve data from the card (either as full files and certificates, or parsed data within these files e.g. first name), sign data with the card,.. .

Samples on how to use the new API will be provided in the SDK.<BR>
Some can be found already in our source section at [http://code.google.com/p/eid-mw/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Fsdk%2FExamples%253Fstate%253Dclosed trunk/sdk/Examples]

Automatic signatures checking of the data files or validating certificates will not be done within the PKCS#11 API. 

*Compatibility*

Backwards compatibility with version 3.5 of the SDK is planned in the form of an extra downloadable package from the eid.belgium.be site.<BR>
Backwards compatibility towards version 2.x of the SDK is planned to be dropped.<BR>
Older eidmw releases will not be compatible with the 4.0 Eidmw SDK.<BR>
